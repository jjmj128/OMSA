# OMSAA
Ontology model for Maintenance Strategy Selection and Assessment

In order to use the OMSSA make sure that all the other ontologies in the repository are correctly imported.

OMSSA was originally intended to import CCO directly from web (specificly the direct imports ofArtifactOntology, InformationEntityOntology and EventOntology). However, as there has been some problems to do so, the authors have decided to keep a local copy of CCO 1.3 to perform local imports and avoid external issues.
