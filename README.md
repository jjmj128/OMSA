# OMSA
Ontology model for maintenance strategy selection and assessment

In order to use the OMSA make sure that all the other ontologies in the repository are correctly imported.

OMSA was originally intended to import CCO directly from web (specificly the direct imports ofArtifactOntology, InformationEntityOntology and EventOntology). However, as there has been some problems to do, the authors have decided to keep a local copy of CCO 1.3 to perform local imports and avoid external issues.
